# Known Issues and Gotchas

## SQLite vs MySQL Differences

The application defaults to SQLite in development, but production usually
runs MySQL or PostgreSQL. This difference causes several gotchas.

SQLite requires an explicit `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` to enforce foreign key
constraints. Without this, orphaned records can accumulate silently. The
database configuration enables this by default, but custom raw SQL queries
must set the pragma manually.

SQLite has limited `ALTER TABLE` support. Most schema changes require
recreating the table. This means migration order matters more — adding a
column to a table that another migration just modified may fail. Check
`Schema::hasColumn()` before adding columns that might already exist.

SQLite does not support `ENUM` types. Enum columns in MySQL are represented
as `TEXT` columns with `CHECK` constraints in SQLite. The migration syntax
differs, and the `check()` method must be used when adding enum-like columns.

SQLite writes lock the entire database file. Under concurrent write load,
"database is locked" errors will occur. This is expected behavior — the
solution is to use MySQL or PostgreSQL in production.

## UUID Considerations

UUID primary keys are larger than integer keys (16 bytes vs 4-8 bytes). This
means indexes are larger and joins are slightly slower. At the expected data
volumes this is not a problem, but it is worth noting for tables that will
grow very large.

UUIDs make database dumps and manual queries less convenient — you cannot
guess a record's ID or iterate through them sequentially. All queries should
use meaningful criteria (email, name, date) rather than relying on ID
ordering.

## Queue Worker Requirement

The queue worker is not optional. Without it, notifications are never sent,
media conversions never happen, mail never goes out, and scheduled tasks
accumulate. In development, the queue can run synchronously (via the `sync`
driver) or by running `php artisan queue:work` in a terminal. In production,
Supervisor or systemd must keep the worker running.

If jobs appear stuck in the "processing" state, the worker likely crashed.
Run the prune-failed command to reset them. If jobs are never picked up,
check that the queue connection in `.env` matches the worker's connection.

## Storage Permissions

The `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` directories must be writable by the web
server user. This includes subdirectories for logs, framework files, views,
and cache. On Linux, this typically means `chown -R www-data:www-data storage
bootstrap/cache`. Without correct permissions, the application returns blank
pages or file upload errors.

SELinux on RHEL-based distributions adds another layer of permissions. The
storage directory needs the `httpd_sys_rw_content_t` context label.

The public storage symlink (`public/storage` -> `storage/app/public`) must
exist for uploaded files and brand assets to be accessible. This is created
by `php artisan storage:link`. If media URLs return 404, the symlink is
likely missing.

## Development Workflow Gotchas

If you see "Unable to locate file in Vite manifest," the frontend assets have
not been built. Run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` (or `composer run dev`
which starts everything).

If configuration changes do not take effect, run `php artisan optimize:clear`
to flush cached config, routes, and views. The config cache must be
regenerated after any change to `config/*.php` files.

If Livewire components do not update after data changes, check that the
component has reactive properties and that `$this->dispatch()` is being used
for inter-component communication.

## Pest Plugin Arch — `toUse()` constraint bug

`pestphp/pest-plugin-arch` has a known issue where the `toUse()` / `not->toUse()`
constraint can cause internal assertion failures on certain PHP/Pest combinations,
resulting in a silent exit code 2 with no visible error message. This is a bug
in the pest arch plugin's reflection-based import scanner, not in the application
code.

**Impact:** Arch tests that use `toUse()` (like `DomainBoundariesArchTest.php`)
may report false failures or fail to produce output. The constraints themselves
are correct — the plugin's assertion runner sometimes misbehaves.

**Mitigation:**
- Run affected arch tests in isolation to verify the intent is correct
- Inspect the source code directly to confirm no unwanted imports exist
- Skip these particular arch tests if the plugin continues to malfunction,
  provided manual verification has been done

This does not create a security gap — the arch tests are structural safeguards,
not runtime protections. The actual dependency graph is enforced at the code
level through namespace conventions and code review.

## Where to Find It

Troubleshooting sections for specific subsystems are in their respective
documentation files. The health check command
(`app/Domain/Core/Console/Commands/HealthCommand.php`) verifies most
environment prerequisites and will identify common misconfigurations.
